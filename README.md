# Scroll Trigger Section in React

This project is a **React-based implementation** of a scroll-triggered animation inspired by Codegrid's tutorial on ScrollTrigger + GSAP Sorcery: Content Transitions That Reacts and Engages. Since the original code was not publicly available, I recreated it in React for easier integration into modern web projects.

## 📌 Features
- **Scroll-triggered animations** using GSAP & ScrollTrigger
- **Fully responsive** design
- **Optimized for performance** in React
- **Reusable components** for easy integration
