# Scroll Trigger Section in HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project is a **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation** of a scroll-triggered animation inspired by codegrid's tutorial on ScrollTrigger + GSAP Sorcery: Content Transitions That Reacts and Engages . Since the original code was not publicly available, I recreated it for easier access and learning.

## 📌 Features
